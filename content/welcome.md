# Let's Rock!

Eeeexactly! That's how we begin this blog. 

But... I don't know if it's ok to call this blog a... blog. Why? Because I would like this site to be a place where we can talk, share, learn and teach freely everything code related.

What makes the difference between the tutorials and examples shown in this posts and the ones on other blogs? Well, the ones on this blog are geeky to the bones! 

So get ready to code warehouse applications for the Death Star, magic recipes for witches in D&D, and login systems to The World game engine.

So let me quote one of my virtual best friends when he starts something cool:

## Let's rock!

PD: If you already realized this quote is from Dante, of Devil May Cry, you have just become one of my best friends, even if we don't meet each other yet :D
